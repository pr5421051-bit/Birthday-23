      <p>
        My love, my intention has always been clear —  
        I don’t just want to love you, I want to marry you and spend my whole life with you 💍  
        I want to celebrate every birthday of yours like it’s the most beautiful day of my life,
        because for me, it truly is.

        <br /><br />

        I know this year I couldn’t take a holiday on your birthday because of my internship,
        but I promise you from my heart — from now on, on every birthday of yours,
        I will take a holiday, no matter what.  
        We will go out together, laugh together, travel together, eat together,
        and make memories that we will remember forever 🌍❤️

        <br /><br />

        Because your birthday is not just a special day for you…  
        it belongs to both of us.  
        It’s the day the person I love the most came into this world,
        and I will always make it feel special for us 💕

        <br /><br />

        Thank you so much for supporting me, believing in me, and loving me the way you do.
        Tumne mujhe ek better insaan banaya hai, aur main hamesha tumhara saath dena chahta hoon.
        Main wada karta hoon ki main tumse shaadi karunga
        aur tumhare saath poori zindagi rahunga — no matter what ❤️

        <br /><br />

        This birthday website is just a small stop, not the end.
        Har saal, har birthday, main tumhe aur zyada surprises dunga,
        aur tumse aur zyada pyaar karunga.
        You are my sweetheart, my love, my future, and my forever 💖

        <br /><br />

        I love you so much, always and forever ❤️
